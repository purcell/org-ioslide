** Editing CSS

[[http://compass-style.org/install/][Compass]] is a CSS preprocessor used to compile
SCSS/SASS into CSS. We chose SCSS for the new slide deck for maintainability,
easier browser compatibility, and because...it's the future!

That said, if not comfortable working with SCSS or don't want to learn something
new, not a problem. The generated .css files can already be found in
(see [[theme/css)][/theme/css]] You can just edit those and bypass SCSS altogether.
However, our recommendation is to use Compass. It's super easy to install and use.

*** Installing Compass and making changes

First, install compass:

: sudo gem update --system
: sudo gem install compass

Next, you'll want to watch for changes to the exiting .scss files in [[theme/scss][/theme/scss]]
and any new one you add:

: $ cd io-2012-slides
: $ compass watch

This command automatically recompiles the .scss file when you make a change.
Its corresponding .css file is output to [[theme/css][/theme/css]]. Slick.

By default, [[config.rb][config.rb]] in the main project folder outputs minified
.css. It's a best practice after all! However, if you want unminified files,
run watch with the style output flag:

    compass watch -s expanded

*Note:* You should not need to edit [[theme/scss/_base.scss][_base.scss]].
